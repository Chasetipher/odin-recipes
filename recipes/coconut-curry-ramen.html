    <h1>Coconut Curry Ramen</h1>

    <h1>This asian fusion dish is a staple at our house</h1>
    <p>No history on this one, I'm afraid. Curry has been around since the early 1600's <br>
    and ramen has debated origins, anywhere from the 17th to the 20th century.<br>
    This fusion recipe is one my mom probably saw on the internet somewhere, but she has been making it for years.</p>

    <p>Grab those ingredients!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (3.5-ounce) packages instant ramen noodles (we don't need the flavor packets!)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons oil (canola works just fine)</li>
        <li>1 medium sweet onion, or 2 medium shallots. Diced.</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons red OR green curry paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>4 minced cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken/veggie stock</li>
        <li>Protein of choice! Pork, chicken or tofu all work great here</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro and soft boiled egg</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Here's how ya make it!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot of boiling water, cook noodles until just tender, about 2-3 minutes. Rinse under cold water and drain; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat canola oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add shallot, and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 3 minutes.<br>

        <li>Stir in coconut milk and chicken stock. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover and simmer until flavors have blended, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide noodles and broth into bowls. Top with protein (if desired), soft boiled eggs and cilantro.</li>
