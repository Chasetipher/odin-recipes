    <h1>This hearty, warming, family favorite is easier to make <br> than you may think!</h1>
    <h3><p>Onion soup has been around since at least Roman times, but the popularity of the dish met <br>
        with a resurgence in the 60's due to a strong influence of French Cuisine. This tasty <br>
        soup has a beef stock base and a heaping of caramellized onions, all topped with crusty bread <br>
        and melted cheese!</p></h3>
        <br>
        <p>Here is what you'll need for 4-6 servings!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 to 4 large red or yellow onions (about 3 pounds), peeled and thinly slice</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste</li>
        <li>2 quarts (8 cups) beef stock</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dry sherry</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper, more to taste</li>
        <li> French bread cut into 8 to 12 1/2-inch slices</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups grated Gruyère cheese</li>
        <br>
    <p>Preparation</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a heavy Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt, stir and cover, <br>
            letting onions soften for 5 minutes. Remove lid and let onions caramelize until golden brown over medium heat, <br>
            stirring occasionally. Adjust heat if onions are browning too quickly. The caramelization process may take 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Once onions are caramelized, add wine and sherry to the pot and allow mixture to come to boil. Stir in flour and let thicken for a minute or two.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Slowly add warm broth, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the pepper to the onion mixture and boil uncovered for 10 minutes. Add more salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat the broiler, and arrange individual ovenproof casseroles on a baking sheet. Ladle soup into casseroles, and cover top with bread slices. <br>
            Sprinkle each casserole generously with Gruyère. Broil for a minute or two, watching carefully, until cheese melts and browns. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
