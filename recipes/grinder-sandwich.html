    <h1>This italian inspired sandwich is sure to make you smile!</h1>
    
    <h3><p>This sandwich was reportedly created in the 1950's in Philadelphia by Italians
       working in Shipyards known as Hog Island. <br> It's name supposedly was a nod to the 
       tough italian bread used to make the sandwich, which you would have to grind your 
       your teeth through. <br> These days, the grinder is making its rounds on popular entertainment
       app, Tiktok! <br> The grinder can be made with pretty much whatever you want, but some of the
       staples include:</p></h3>
       <ul>
           <li>Sub roll, french bread or equivalent hoagie</li>

           <li>Tangy iceberg lettuce slaw</li>
