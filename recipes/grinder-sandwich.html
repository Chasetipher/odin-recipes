    <h1>This italian inspired sandwich is sure to make your friends and family smile!</h1>
    
    <p>This sandwich was reportedly created in the 1950's in Philadelphia by Italians
       working in Shipyards known as Hog Island. It's name supposedly was a nod to the 
       tough italian bread used to make the sandwich, which you would have to grind your 
       your teeth through. These days, the grinder is making its rounds on popular entertainment
       app, Tiktok! The grinder can be made with pretty much whatever you want, but some of the
       staples include:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Sub roll, french bread or equivalent hoagie</li>
           <li>Italian meats like salami and pepperoni and ham</li>
           <li>Tangy iceberg lettuce slaw</li>
           <li>Fresh cut tomatoes</li>
           <li>Cheese! Provolone is our choice</li>
           <li>Pepper rings</li>
       </ul>
